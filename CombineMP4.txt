# This creates output commands for FFMPEG that will cut and join multipule MP4 files without re-encoding (Loss-less)
# There are 2 parts to this. Part 1 will generate the commands to generate intermediate files 1.mts, 2.mts, 3.mts etc.
# Part 2 generates the command to join all the intermediate files.
#
# With the command below one can create an csv file that will signify in and out point of 
#
# Example of List.txt
#
# File,in,out,description
# QuickLaneChange.mp4,00:00:07,00:00:12,Change
#
#
# I created this because I like editing video files and I like FFMPEG. However cutting and joining MP4 files and needing
# to create intermediat files can be quite tedious. These commands help alot.

# Part 1

# Part 2
